# Escape from Grey Sky Labs
## A simple gui text-based game written in python

Background:

🔬 Grey Industries and 💊 Sky Labs are two of the largest chemical companies in the nation.
The two companies are planning a merger to create Grey Sky Labs, but they need to bring in third-party auditors
to look over the books before further merger discussions.

👩🏻‍🔬

It is your job to take a closer look at Grey Industries and decide if the merger should move forward.

You will only have a single day, and a single night at the headquarters of Grey Industries
to gather your information.

# Books
Books play a critical role in the game. If you create your own scenario of the game, create books as .txt files.

###### Format
Name the file what you wish to title the book as.
Book title = file name.txt
Example: "Dictionary.txt"

Each line of the text file will be split into a page of the book.
